TODO

clean up useless types and sub types at the end

We have duplicate code around item_type and item_sub_type, check if it would not be better to have a unique item_type class
  with a recursive and polymorphic hierarchy
  this will mean changing the natural id of item_types from [:name] to [:name,:depth] or maybe we could getaway with name right now ...
