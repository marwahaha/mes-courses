TODO

summary, photo and price of items
- refactor the have_mostly rspec expectation to something like .should mostly have_different(:name) ou .should mostly have_non_null(:price)
- display -> feature: verify that each item has a price, a summary and a photo displayed
- download auchan's site with photos (or not ?)

questions:
 - Should the url for the photo be in the model ? -> yes
 - What's in auchan's items ? -> photo, summary and price !
