try with central_logger
try to use the ENV['MONGODBHQ'] from the yml file on heroku, maybe it will work -> it works
    or branch central logger to allow a custom hard coded config
check that the scrapping logs work with mongo logger
see if heroku keeps database.yml files or if it is ignored, maybe we could work with another config file (mongoid.yml or whatever)
try to use console on heroku and to get logs from it
if it works, update gems localy ... gloups!
