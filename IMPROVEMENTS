IMPROVEMENTS
------------
Things to do (at least partialy) at the first occasion when coding something arround the subject

Put everything in the repo	thirdparties source code, dev tools, follow up, marketing …
Make a restful ressource of CartLines
deduce body_id from path_bar
Rename ressource controllers to plural
Split import tests in remote_spec for the items_api, and spec for the import, make import feature more deterministic and user centered (verification through gui and names)
  - Fork store_api remote_specs (with statistics as before), use offline files when offline?
  - use mock store_api when testing the import
  - use mock store_api when running import features
  - move testing strategry into the mock store_api
  - bonus : run features with autospec !
Switch to synchronous continuous integration. Have a rake task that does it all and a local ci env
Write a script to setup dev env
Have a ci env on heroku	RACK_ENV=test
Use postgre as dev db
Insert spec logs in watchdog emails
Use special auchandirect.fr account while testing
Create an import record type
Append "_index" to the end of the name of db indexes, remove duplicate "altered_" indexes
migrer à rails 3
Use tags to segregate remote specs and features
Check RR mocks or Not a mock frameworks, or make a generic call logger mock
Create a root category to simplify item_category_controller
I had to hard code www.mes-courses.fr at various points in the cms (blog and a propos links, links inside a blog post (for mail subscription)
upgrade radiant, use comment extensions gem
Review stubs usages : use factories everywhere to initialize stubs and models, use real models were possible (problems with id initialization, verify 2 way association api)
Reduce accessibility in models
use button_to to transfert cart to auchan (instead of hand written form)
