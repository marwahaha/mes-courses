IMPROVEMENTS
------------
Things to do (at least partialy) at the first occasion when coding something arround the subject

[WIP] Use special auchandirect.fr account while testing
[WIP] Insert spec logs in watchdog emails
[WIP] add foreign key constraints

Use strings to save order status in the db
Use a gem instead of an extension to enable act_as_tree, remove selenium remote control from the repo
Check import through web interface when testing with cucumber -> split this improvement in pieces, change one scenario per commit
add a foreign key from cart_lines -> items
 - move items to a new category instead of deleting them
 - fix global item search
Switch to synchronous continuous integration. Have a local ci env, and a rake task that checks everything and commits at the end
 - have another integration directory
 - write an integrate script that :
   - goes in this integration directory
   - pulls master from dev repo
   - launches rake ci, as is doing cc.net
   - pushes to origin master if build succeeded
   - pushes to heroku (dev and watchdog) if build succeeded ?
   - always go back to origin directory
   - stop cc.net
Have a ci env on heroku	RACK_ENV=test (use watchodg?)
   - run it during the integrate script ?
upgrade gems
migrer à rails 3
Use tags to segregate remote specs and features
I had to hard code www.mes-courses.fr at various points in the cms (blog and a propos links, links inside a blog post (for mail subscription)
upgrade radiant, use comment extensions gem, see how bundler helps to auto expand submodules
Write scripts
   - a sh script in the dropbox to install git, ruby, gems, bundler and rake
   - a rake setup task in the project to install all dependencies with bundler and apt-get
   - in order to get a single entry point, check to see if push.sh, pull-cms.sh and push-cms.sh could be moved to rake tasks
Put everything in the repo : thirdparties source code, dev tools, follow up, marketing …

Spikes :
Should we use rake scripts instead of sh scripts ?
2 way associations in active record
How to control accessibility in models
Rspec-spies + .ordered, try to add it (wait for rspec 2)
Regarder ce qu'apporte NoSql pour les problèmes de Foreign Keys

Ongoing changes :
Try to use more real objects and factories
Upgrade gems before every feature
Upgrade radiant gems & extensions before every blog post
