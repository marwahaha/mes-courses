IMPROVEMENTS
------------
Things to do (at least partialy) at the first occasion when coding something arround the subject

Put everything in the repo	thirdparties source code, dev tools, follow up, marketing …
Make a restful ressource of CartLines
deduce body_id from path_bar
Rename ressource controllers to plural
Check import through web interface when testing with cucumber
Improve the DummyStoreItemAPI to ease testing (add item, remove items ...)
Use singleton behind DummyStoreItemAPI to ease testing
Switch to synchronous continuous integration. Have a rake task that does it all and a local ci env
Write a script to setup dev env
Have a ci env on heroku	RACK_ENV=test
Use postgre as dev and test db (this should remove duplicate "altered_" indexes), write rake tasks to setup the env
Insert spec logs in watchdog emails
Use special auchandirect.fr account while testing
Create an import record type
Append "_index" to the end of the name of db indexes
migrer à rails 3
Use tags to segregate remote specs and features
Use rspec-spies where easier
Once on rspec 2.x, try to use rspec-spies like should have_receive(:xxx).just_before(:yyy), try to add it
Create a root category to simplify item_category_controller
I had to hard code www.mes-courses.fr at various points in the cms (blog and a propos links, links inside a blog post (for mail subscription)
upgrade radiant, use comment extensions gem
Review stubs usages : use factories everywhere to initialize stubs and models, use real models were possible (problems with id initialization, verify 2 way association api)
Reduce accessibility in models
use button_to to transfert cart to auchan (instead of hand written form)
