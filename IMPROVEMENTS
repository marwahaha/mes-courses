IMPROVEMENTS
------------
Things to do (at least partialy) at the first occasion when coding something arround the subject

WIP
---
migrer vers ruby 1.9

TODO
----
upgrade gems 'bundle update' before starting any dev !
 - try to set very loose version specifiers in Gemfile, let the update specify real version in Gemfile.lock
 - add a rake task to upgrate + test
migrer à rails 3
find a way to subclass Devise::SessionsController without cut-and-paste
Understand why capybara is now prefered to web steps
 - read this : http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off
 - upgrade our cucumber steps
Website:
- use heroku daily backup instead of our duck tape solution
- Speed up deployment when integrating : in parallel, or asynchronously on another server
- Check the deployment was successful by doing a get to http://app-name.heroku.com and checking the http return status
add a foreign key from cart_lines -> items
 - move items to a new category instead of deleting them, fix global item search
 - or version the items : check that it will not be too big
Use tags to segregate remote specs and features
Write scripts
   - move scripts that don't change the db or the app env in script/XXX
   - see radiant:upgrade task to see how they managed an update or even git ops through rake
   - a sh script in the dropbox to install git, compile ruby and gems
   - a script in the project to compile gems, and then gem install bundler and rake
   - a rake setup task in the project to install all dependencies with bundler and apt-get
Put everything in the repo : thirdparties source code, dev tools, follow up, marketing … maybe I'll need to have a main git repo with submodules
Install windows and all browsers with VirtuaBox
Make a web site where one can check logs of heroku apps

CMS:
move pull-cms and push-cms in scripts/

Spikes :
2 way associations in active record
How to control accessibility in models
Rspec-spies + .ordered, try to add it (wait for rspec 2)
Regarder ce qu'apporte NoSql pour les problèmes de Foreign Keys
Evaluer les tests avec moins de mock - try to add an rspec extension creating proxies
try to launch ci on heroku (might be a problem with db drop ...)
see how to test ssl requirements in cucumber and/or local dev

Kanban:
Simplify marketing metrics and use metrics of the pirates
Simplify the milestones and planning ... it must be automatic

Ongoing changes :
Upgrade gems before every feature
Upgrade radiant gems & extensions before every blog post
