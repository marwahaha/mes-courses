IMPROVEMENTS
------------
Things to do (at least partialy) at the first occasion when coding something arround the subject

[WIP] Use special auchandirect.fr account while testing
[WIP] Insert spec logs in watchdog emails

Use postgre as dev and test db (this should remove duplicate "altered_" indexes), write rake tasks to setup the env
Append "_index" to the end of the name of db indexes
Check import through web interface when testing with cucumber
Switch to synchronous continuous integration. Have a rake task that does it all and a local ci env
Have a ci env on heroku	RACK_ENV=test
upgrade gems
migrer à rails 3
Use tags to segregate remote specs and features
I had to hard code www.mes-courses.fr at various points in the cms (blog and a propos links, links inside a blog post (for mail subscription)
upgrade radiant, use comment extensions gem
Write a script to setup dev env
Put everything in the repo : thirdparties source code, dev tools, follow up, marketing …

Spikes :
2 way associations in active record
How to control accessibility in models
Rspec-spies + .ordered, try to add it (wait for rspec 2)

Ongoing changes :
